# Blackjack

![Blackjack](blackjack_demo.gif)

With each project I try to add something new so I can continue to grow as a person and developer.

In this project:
- Created a full on blackjack game where you can split, double down, adjust wagers, hit, and stay.

- If you have gone to a casino, you know that every table/place that you go to has different number of decks they play with. Therefore, I have allowed the user to choose how many decks they want to play with. Also, the cards reshuffle once there is only 1/8th of the cards remaining.

- I have implemented a win/loss/tie tracker to later create data/statistics/graphs on your games (ie. how many times you busted with a starting hand of 16, how many times the dealer loses when it shows a 6 as the starting card, and so much more).

- Behind the scenes I created Authentication/Authorization utilizing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Reach Router to properly navigate the user to where they need/want to go.

- I created the front-end using Javascript, React, CSS/SCSS, and HTML.

- I also created a back-end using Node, Express, and MongoDB to store users login information, and their in-game stats.
